Glennson Madeja

I joined the open house because I am interested in enrolling in the Tech Career Program. I’d like to refresh and enhance my basic web development skills to prepare for a career shift.

I am currently a Project Officer at a medical equipment company. I initially joined the organization as a Product Specialist and later became the company’s authorized representative for government procurement. Eventually, I transitioned to the inventory team, where I implemented several innovations, including the use of QR codes to track documents and deliveries.
